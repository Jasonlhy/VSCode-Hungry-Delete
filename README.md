# Hungry Delete Extension for Visual Studio Code
Hungry Delete Extension for Visual Studio Code

I find it very annoying to press backspace multiple time in order to remove the leading tabs or whitespaces in order to return to the previos end of the line. Therefore, I create this extension and it just overrides the `ctrl+backspace` key binding, once `ctrl+backspace` is pressed, a command is executed.

# Features
`ctrl+backspace` to delete ALL tab or whitespaces before the cursor, until it reachs a non empty line.

# Development
1. `git clone https://github.com/Jasonlhy/VSCode-Hungry-Delete.git`
2. `npm install`
